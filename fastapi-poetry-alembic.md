Okay, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on setting up a FastAPI project using Poetry for dependency management, Alembic for database migrations, integrating PostgreSQL and Redis, and containerizing everything with Docker and Docker Compose. This guide focuses on the setup process and commands, without providing the full code for the application logic, models, or specific configurations.

**Assumptions:**

- You have Python (3.8+ recommended) installed.
- You have Poetry installed (see Poetry's official documentation for installation).
- You have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

---

**Phase 1: Project Initialization and Core Dependencies**

1.  **Create Project Directory:**

    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

    ```bash
    mkdir my_fastapi_project
    cd my_fastapi_project
    ```

2.  **Initialize Poetry:**

    - Use Poetry to initialize a new Python project. This will create a `pyproject.toml` file to manage dependencies and project settings. You can accept the defaults or customize them.

    ```bash
    poetry init
    ```

    - Follow the interactive prompts. Make sure to specify a compatible Python version (e.g., `^3.10`).

3.  **Add Core FastAPI Dependencies:**

    - Add FastAPI itself and an ASGI server like Uvicorn to run it. The `[standard]` option for Uvicorn includes helpful extras like `websockets` and `httptools` for better performance.

    ```bash
    poetry add fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"
    ```

4.  **Create Basic Application Structure (Conceptual):**
    - Although we're not writing full code, you'll need a place for your application. Create a source directory (e.g., `app`) and an initial entry point file.
    ```bash
    mkdir app
    touch app/main.py
    touch app/__init__.py
    ```
    - _Inside `app/main.py`, you would typically define your FastAPI app instance (`app = FastAPI()`) and maybe a root endpoint._

---

**Phase 2: Database (PostgreSQL) and ORM Setup**

1.  **Add SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL Driver:**

    - SQLAlchemy is a popular ORM for Python. `psycopg2-binary` is the driver needed to connect SQLAlchemy to PostgreSQL.

    ```bash
    poetry add sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
    ```

    - _(Note: For asynchronous operations, you might later consider `asyncpg` instead of `psycopg2-binary` and adapt your database session logic accordingly)._

2.  **Plan Database Configuration (Conceptual):**
    - You'll need a way to configure the database connection URL. This is typically done via environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`). We'll set these later via Docker Compose.
    - _You would typically create files like `app/database.py` to handle database session creation/management and `app/models.py` to define your SQLAlchemy ORM models._

---

**Phase 3: Database Migrations with Alembic**

1.  **Add Alembic:**

    - Alembic integrates with SQLAlchemy to handle database schema migrations.

    ```bash
    poetry add alembic
    ```

2.  **Initialize Alembic:**

    - Run the Alembic initialization command. This creates an `alembic` directory and an `alembic.ini` configuration file. It's often best to run this via `poetry run` to ensure it uses the project's virtual environment.

    ```bash
    poetry run alembic init alembic
    ```

3.  **Configure Alembic (Conceptual):**
    - **`alembic.ini`:** You need to edit this file to tell Alembic where your database is. Find the `sqlalchemy.url` line and set it (though often this is better loaded dynamically from environment variables in `env.py`). For now, you might comment it out or set a placeholder, knowing Docker Compose will provide the real one later.
      - Example placeholder: `sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://user:password@db:5432/mydatabase` (using `db` as the service name from Docker Compose).
    - **`alembic/env.py`:** This file needs to be modified to:
      - Import your SQLAlchemy base metadata from your models file (e.g., `from app.models import Base`).
      - Set the `target_metadata` variable to your Base's metadata (e.g., `target_metadata = Base.metadata`).
      - Potentially add logic to read the `DATABASE_URL` from environment variables instead of relying solely on `alembic.ini`.

---

**Phase 4: Redis Integration**

1.  **Add Redis Client:**

    - Add the Python client library for Redis.

    ```bash
    poetry add redis
    ```

    - _(Note: For asynchronous operations, you might later consider `aioredis`)_.

2.  **Plan Redis Configuration (Conceptual):**
    - Similar to the database, you'll need Redis connection details (host, port, potentially password). These will also be provided via environment variables (e.g., `REDIS_HOST=redis`, `REDIS_PORT=6379`).
    - _You might create a file like `app/cache.py` or `app/redis_client.py` to manage the Redis connection pool and provide utility functions._

---

**Phase 5: Dockerization**

1.  **Create `Dockerfile`:**

    - Create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension) in the project root. This file contains instructions to build a Docker image for your FastAPI application.

    ```bash
    touch Dockerfile
    ```

    - **Conceptual `Dockerfile` Structure:**
      - Start from a Python base image (`FROM python:3.10-slim`).
      - Set environment variables (e.g., `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`).
      - Set the working directory (`WORKDIR /app`).
      - Install Poetry (`RUN pip install poetry`).
      - Copy only dependency files (`COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./`).
      - Install dependencies using Poetry, excluding development dependencies and avoiding installing the project itself as editable (`RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false && poetry install --no-dev --no-interaction --no-ansi`). _Note: `virtualenvs.create false` installs into the system Python within the container._
      - Copy the rest of your application code (`COPY ./app /app/app`).
      - Expose the port Uvicorn will run on (`EXPOSE 8000`).
      - Define the command to run the application (`CMD ["poetry", "run", "uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]`). The host `0.0.0.0` is crucial to accept connections from outside the container.

2.  **Create `.dockerignore`:**
    - Create a file named `.dockerignore` in the project root to exclude unnecessary files/folders from the Docker build context, making builds faster and image sizes smaller.
    ```bash
    touch .dockerignore
    ```
    - **Conceptual `.dockerignore` Content:**
      ```
      __pycache__/
      *.pyc
      *.pyo
      *.pyd
      .Python
      env/
      venv/
      .venv/
      *.egg-info/
      .git/
      .gitignore
      .dockerignore
      docker-compose.yaml
      README.md
      alembic/versions/
      .pytest_cache/
      .mypy_cache/
      # Add other files/dirs specific to your setup
      ```

---

**Phase 6: Docker Compose Orchestration**

1.  **Create `docker-compose.yaml`:**

    - Create a file named `docker-compose.yaml` in the project root. This file defines and configures the multi-container application (FastAPI app, PostgreSQL DB, Redis).

    ```bash
    touch docker-compose.yaml
    ```

2.  **Define Services in `docker-compose.yaml` (Conceptual):**
    - **`version`:** Specify the Compose file version (e.g., `'3.8'`).
    - **`services`:** Define each container:
      - **`web` (FastAPI App):**
        - `build: .` (Tells Compose to build the image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory).
        - `command:` (Optional: Override the Dockerfile CMD, useful for development with features like `--reload`). Example: `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`
        - `volumes:` (Mount your local code into the container for development so changes are reflected without rebuilding). Example: `./app:/app/app`
        - `ports:` (Map host port to container port). Example: `"8000:8000"`
        - `environment:` (Pass environment variables for configuration). Examples:
          - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://myuser:mypassword@db:5432/mydatabase`
          - `REDIS_HOST=redis`
        - `depends_on:` (Ensure `db` and `redis` start before the `web` service). Example: `['db', 'redis']`
      - **`db` (PostgreSQL):**
        - `image: postgres:15` (Use an official PostgreSQL image, specify a version).
        - `volumes:` (Persist database data outside the container). Example: `postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/`
        - `environment:` (Configure the PostgreSQL instance). Examples:
          - `POSTGRES_USER=myuser`
          - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword`
          - `POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase`
        - `ports:` (Optional: Map host port to container port for external access if needed). Example: `"5432:5432"`
      - **`redis` (Redis):**
        - `image: redis:7` (Use an official Redis image, specify a version).
        - `ports:` (Optional: Map host port to container port for external access). Example: `"6379:6379"`
    - **`volumes`:** Define named volumes used by the services (e.g., `postgres_data: {}`).

---

**Phase 7: Running and Managing the Application**

1.  **Build and Start Containers:**

    - Open your terminal in the project root directory where `docker-compose.yaml` is located.
    - Build the images (especially the `web` service image) and start all services in detached mode (`-d`).

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    - _(Subsequent starts can often omit `--build` unless the Dockerfile or dependencies change): `docker-compose up -d`_

2.  **Check Container Status:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```

3.  **View Logs:**

    - View logs for all services: `docker-compose logs -f`
    - View logs for a specific service (e.g., `web`): `docker-compose logs -f web`

4.  **Run Alembic Migrations:**

    - Once the containers are running, you need to execute Alembic commands _inside_ the `web` container.
    - **Generate a new migration script (after making changes to your SQLAlchemy models):**
      ```bash
      docker-compose exec web poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Your descriptive migration message"
      ```
      _(This creates a new file in `alembic/versions/`)_.
    - **Apply migrations to the database:**
      ```bash
      docker-compose exec web poetry run alembic upgrade head
      ```

5.  **Access Your Application:**

    - If you mapped port 8000, you should be able to access your FastAPI application at `http://localhost:8000` (or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) in your web browser.

6.  **Stop Containers:**
    - Stop and remove the containers, networks, etc., defined in the Compose file.
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
    - To also remove the named volumes (like `postgres_data`), use:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

This step-by-step guide provides the commands and conceptual structure for setting up your FastAPI project with Poetry, Alembic, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker. Remember to replace placeholders and conceptual descriptions with your actual application logic, model definitions, and specific configuration details in the respective files (`app/main.py`, `app/models.py`, `app/database.py`, `alembic/env.py`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yaml`, etc.).
